Project folder structure:
 
<_top_level_project_folder>
   <src>  folder containing all hdl and constraint files/folders. (keep under svn)
   <proj> vivado project folder generated by running mk_proj.tcl (NOT under svn)
   mk_prj.tcl Tcl script to create a project in <proj> subfolder. (keep under svn)
   
   (ainda nao utilizado) <sdk>  folder for sdk export (hw folder + more as needed under svn)
   (ainda nao utilizado) <ip>   folder containing all ip used in this project. (keep under svn) 
          Note: some of these may be projects that MAY also follow this directory structure.
   (ainda nao utilizado) mk_bd.tcl Tcl script to create new bd within project. (keep under svn)

Instructions for creating project from scratch:
1) start vivado_tcl console and change into project_folder directory
2) delete <proj> folder contents (make a cleanup script for this someday)
3) run >source mk_proj.tcl
4) go to <proj> folder and open newly created project 
   (Note: you may need to make sure project is targeting the correct part!)
5) (ainda nao utilizado) at tcl console in project run:
   >source mk_bd.tcl 
6) (ainda nao utilizado) regenerate output products for bd design
7) (ainda nao utilizado) create wrapper for bd design (this should be something instantiated by HDL already in the design)
